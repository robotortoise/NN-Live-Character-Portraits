# Naninovel - Live Character Portraits
I wanted to have the characters in the text printer update live based on the actual animation that the character is doing a la a AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES, but there was no explict way to do this in the Naninovel documentation. Thus, I set out doing it myself, and have open-sourced it so others can use this for their projects.


You are free to use as a base to build off of. It uses test assets from *Escape From Somnium*, and requires the Unity plugin [Naninovel](https://naninovel.com/) and Unity 6+ to run.
